# Interview Helper
A series of Java classes the help with interview revision, covering
areas such as algorithms, graphs, trees and collections.
 
Recently, a friend and I got into a discussion about this subject
at work, in no other industry is there such a discrepancy between
what you'll be asked to do in an interview, and what you'll be
asked to work on upon arrival.

I think it's such a shame that this divide exists, and it basically
means that we all have to revise on algorithms before interviewing.
This project should be read along with the following page on my 
website:

* Graph based depth first traversal
* Graph based breadth first traversal
